```{tab-item} Things I learned
- Hands-on practice makes things much clearer after listening to the lectures
- Basic differences between markdown and html formatting
- How to actually create a functional webpage!
- Learning GitHub usage was also pretty cool!
```
  
```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
- The _toc.yml was the most challenging! Took me hours to figure out the parts: key piece.
- Linking citations.
- The coding structure overall was new to me so almost everything took way longer than it should, since once I got stuck on a code, there wasn't a way to move on without fixing it.
- Attaching images is somewhat confusing. Now sure why it works now but it wasn't for the longest time.
